will result in the release of better and improved product qualities.
t is natural that a team of software developers will comprise of excellence, good, average and poor developers. It is important that the bad codes which are generated by the developers should be stopped or otherwise, the production time will increase very much.  DevOps helps in reducing the bad code limits since the bad codes will not be permitted to go to the next level until they are corrected. So this is the technique with the help of which DevOps eliminates bad developers.
