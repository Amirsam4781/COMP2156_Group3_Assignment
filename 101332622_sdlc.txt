In the present market, it is very important to provide software continuously to the market and DevOps helps in achieving that.
The concept of DevOps does not allow mistakes in the stage of methodology. When both the operations and development stages are done correctly with no errors then it 
will result in the release of better and improved product qualities.
t is natural that a team of software developers will comprise of excellence, good, average and poor developers. It is important that the bad codes which are generated by the developers should be stopped or otherwise, the production time will increase very much.  DevOps helps in reducing the bad code limits since the bad codes will not be permitted to go to the next level until they are corrected. So this is the technique with the help of which DevOps eliminates bad developers. 
If the operations and development teams are in different silos then obviously it will be a hard task to identify whether the application is ready for operation or not. The time of the cycle of operation is generally extended when the development team an application. Now if the development and the operation team work together then the application will be ready in a much faster time. This is a very important factor for companies to succeed since in this market where competition is so huge you will have an upper hand if you give innovative services at a faster rate.
