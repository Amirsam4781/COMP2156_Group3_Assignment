DevOps is important to learn because it helps in the cycle of development by reducing time,
while also providing a faster and more convenient way for developers to make sure their 
project is running properly.

UPDATE:
DevOps is additionally beneficial for communication around the team for a project. Every
change and additions to the project can be seen by members of the team to ensure a smooth
collaborative process.
